					<p><b>Mystery Log: The "Markov" Ghost</b> - I was crawling some old USENET archives and found a user named 'Smith291' who has been posting thousands of strings of random words every hour since 1994. Some people think it's a broken spy station, and if you read the first letter of every tenth word, it almost looks like coordinates. Probably just a bot glitch, but it’s creepy to see it still running in 2005.</p>

					<p>Has anyone ever heard of a game called "Polybius"? I saw a post on a message board claiming it was an arcade game in Portland that caused seizures and was visited by "men in black." Sounds like total bunk, but the guy had a photo of a cabinet with no branding. Probably just a home-grown cabinet mod, but the story is a fun one to read at 2 AM.</p>

					<p><b>Mystery Log: Shortwave Weirdness</b> - Tuned my old radio into 4625 kHz tonight. It’s "The Buzzer" (UVB-76). It’s just been a constant, low-frequency buzz for years, but apparently, every few months, a voice reads out names in Russian. Why is it still broadcasting? It’s been decades since the Cold War ended. Just a "dead man's switch," or something else?</p>

					<p><b>Project: The "Doom III" Benchmark (Final)</b> - Finally got it stable. 45 FPS at 1024x768 with Ultra settings. The shadows in this game are insane.

					<p>Found a weird "Dead Air" site today. It’s just a black page with an embedded RealPlayer stream of a room somewhere in Ohio. There’s a clock on the wall and a ceiling fan spinning. That’s it. No audio. People in the chat say the clock hasn't moved in three years. Is it a loop, or just the world's most boring webcam?</p>

He sounds like he’s losing his mind, but his technical description of packet switching is super weird nonetheless. Just a very dedicated LARPer, I assume.</p>
